Masai is a bootcamp based institute that offers various technical courses like: Full Stack Web Developer, Data Analytics (Both full time as well as part time).
The curricullum of Masai is very hectic and sometimes frustating. Students from Non-Technical background have to struggle more than students coming from Technical background.
Being a Student of Non-Tech background my journey at Masai was sometimes frustrating when i was not able to solve assigments and also not able to solve Evaluation questions.
what I feel is Masai should give students more time to do self study. I am suggesting this as per my personal experience.

Till the week comes to an end, I think to study for evaluations but on the same hand i also have to complete pending assignments on time.
So, I either complete assignments or study for the evaluations.

Thank You!
